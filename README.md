# Advent of Code Day 1

copy your session cookie from chrome, then you can:

```
http https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1/input Cookie:session=XXX > inputs/day1
```

or just copy and paste stuff to the inputs folder...

and for now I'm just running things like this 

```
elixir day1.ex
```

I'm doing the dev work on this via Visual Studio Online and using nix and direnv to manage my workspace dependencies
